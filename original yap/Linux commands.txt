so this is the command to image it 
its better than the one in the cloning guide i wrote it makes it a few hours faster probably 

```sudo dd if=/dev/sde bs=4M status=progress conv=sparse of=sparse_2tb.img```

"sde" is the source drive and will change between systems so it has to be checked 
"sparse_2tb.img" is the output image

```sudo bmaptool create -o sparse_2tb.img.bmap sparse_2tb.img```
"sparse_2tb.img.bmap" is the output file 
"sparse_2tb.img" is the source image that gets scanned for mapping 
bmap is to save yourself either hours or minutes when writing back 
for the netflix exploit it saved hours of people writing back the bmap maps out the space that is already 0s and skips writing thus saving time 

compression takes a bit of time if the image will be shared 

this is how it should be done 

bmap file named image.bmap in a folder called .meta 
(on linux you press some button combo to show hidden folders which the . causes)
then in the same place with the sparse image you place the .meta folder then you zip them
compression takes a while then you can also 7z the .zip for a bit more compression 
But the .zip itself already greatly compresses it 

then you use belena etcher to write the .zip that you extract first from the .7z if its in one 
the netflix n hack instructions can be used as reference 

the images allow personal backups of legit games between consoles 
sideloading fpkgs and retail apps on consoles albeit with an already jailbroken ps4 or ps5 required to make the image
probably other shenanigans
