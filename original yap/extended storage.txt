Very sorry for the yap below just wanted to explain everything for future reference 

on ps4 extended storage is easier to deal with 
unlike on ps5 and its m.2 extended storage which requires exact size images 
the ps4 drive source can be 256gb and target 1tb and it works and shows the pkg
unlike ps5 though 
the source firmware matters meaning it cant be used on lower firmware than it was made on at least on ps4 could not test on ps5 

Lucky us that extended storage of PS4 works over onto PS5 
Double lucky that like I mentioned it's flexible on the size smaller to larger 

And then the 3rd stroke of luck is that @terex777 showed us how to add PS5 apps to extended storage 

This isn't usually a thing through retail 
The PS5 stops you from moving PS5 media apps and or games to extended storage 

But if you FTP into ext0 on a PS4 you can drop in the *installed* version of a ps5 app via a folder path that starts with ps5 at the root of ext0 and continues with the folders of an installed app from ps5
Then when you plug it into PS5 you can't run the app from extended storage but you can move it to internal and then launch it 
So for the purpose of netflix on PS4 and PS5 we'll now have extended storage images that are flexible removing the need for m.2 on PS5 
PS4 licence requirement still stands 

To note the external storage method seems to be fiddly after 9.60 

2nd note the PS4 extended storage is usually firmware limited 
The image that will be uploaded is from 9.00 PS4 
This is for ps4 users since the vulnerable app itself is 9.00 minimum 
But since the PS5 extended storage is made on the same firmware if some limitation applies it'll be equivalent to 4.00 or so 
The PS5 version of the app works on 4.03 and above so it should be close enough
